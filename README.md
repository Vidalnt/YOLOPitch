# YOLOPitch: A Time-Frequency Dual-Branch Neural Network for Pitch Estimation

YOLOPitch Architecture

*Current Implementation Status: Class Imbalance Challenge in PTDB Dataset*

## Overview

YOLOPitch is a time-frequency dual-branch neural network model for pitch estimation that mimics human pitch perception mechanisms. The model simultaneously processes both waveform (temporal information) and STFT spectrum (spectral information) to achieve state-of-the-art pitch estimation performance.

## Community Support Requested

Given the uncertainty around the proper implementation strategy for handling class imbalance in YOLOPitch:

- Researchers who have successfully implemented YOLOPitch are encouraged to share their approaches
- The original authors may wish to clarify their methodology for handling class imbalance
- The community is invited to contribute insights on effective strategies for pitch estimation with imbalanced datasets
